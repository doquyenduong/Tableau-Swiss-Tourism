There are two projects under the module "Tourism and Open data space" at HSLU:
- Group project for Gastrosuisse
- Individual project 

## Group project: Impact of COVID-19 on tourism
* Background: Covid-19 has brought international tourism to a worldwide standstill (lockdown, travel restrictions, quarantine regulations, “new” consumer behaviour). Around 55 % of overnight stays in Switzerland are attributable to foreign guests. Early assumptions arose that Swiss guests would compensate for the absence of foreign guests. Domestic demand has remained extremely constant over the last 15 years. Domestic tourists are the backbone of local tourism and stabilise overall demand. This is particularly true in times when foreign tourists is subject to fluctuations. Recent data of overnight stays now show the potential of domestic tourism for the first time.
* Task: Students carry out an analysis, evaluation and visualisation of the accommodation statistics (HESTA). They present the development of overnight stays, countries of origin, number of establishments, rooms and beds, room and bed occupancy rates for Switzerland, for specific regions and for selected cantons and municipalities. This results in tables and diagrams. The visualisations should highlight developments, dependencies and trends. Possible outputs: The development of overnight stays from selected countries of origin for selected regions/cantons/communities; Comparison of different regions / cantons according to selected variables (overnight stays, countries of origin, establishments, rooms, beds, occupancy rates). This task can also be divided into several questions: Development at federal level, development in selected cantons and municipalities (mountain areas vs. urban centres).

* Objective: The results should provide the tourism industry with additional knowledge about the impact of Covid-19.
Data availability: The data from the FSO on overnight stays go back to 1934. The data on overnight stays and guest countries of origin are available online.

## Individual work: Member survey by GastroSuisse on the situation in the hospitality industry after the lockdown
* Background: At the end of July Gastrosuisse asked its members about the current business situation (turnover, personnel, development of demand, cantonal controls of the protection concepts and their consequences). 2’015 GastroSuisse members took part in the survey.
* questions: Students are free to choose the questions to be asked. Possible questions are: How did turnover develop in July compared to the same month last year? Are there regional differences? Which companies have laid off staff or are introducing short-time working? How has consumer behaviour changed and which companies are reacting to changing consumer behaviour?
* Task: GastroSuisse and other tourism associations have conducted numerous member surveys in recent months to find out more about the current situation. This information is an important basis for the association's work. The most recent GastroSuisse member survey dates from the end of July 2020 and its results are to be analysed in greater depth. The innovative visualisation is crucial. Attractive and interactive graphics (e.g. an interactive map of Switzerland) should result. A possible focus is the development of turnover compared to the same month last year (questions 5 and 6). However, the focus can be chosen freely.
* Objective: To combine different questions. The combination of data is intended to provide insights that have not yet been identified.
* Data availability: This task refers to the latest GastroSuisse member survey (July 2020) on the situation in the hospitality industry after the lockdown. GastroSuisse can provide all necessary data itself.

## Software:
* Both projects used Tableau
